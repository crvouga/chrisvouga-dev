Hello, my name is Chris Vouga. I'm a software developer based in the Phoenix Valley. I find it a lot of fun to create things that live on the web. A random fact about me is that I play the drums. I have achieved a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Arizona State University.
